#	Graphical Interfaces - Commando
#
#	Each command in MPW has a graphical interface for specifying
#	parameters and options.  To use this feature, either follow the command
#	name with an ellipsis character (Option-semicolon), or use the command name
# 	alone, but depress the Option key while pressing Enter.  Notice the
#	help text for each of the options.
#
#	For an example, select and execute the Date command below.
#	(Triple click on the line and press the Enter key.)

#	Frequently Used Commands
#
#	A number of frequently used commands appear below.  To execute the
#	command, triple click on the desired line and press Enter.  A commando 
#	window will appear.
#
#	As you use these commands, add your favorite options, and other
#  frequently used commands.

# 	Searching
# 
# 	There occasionally arises the need to search all of a hierarchical directory/file
# 	structure for instances of some regular expression.  The following command will 
#	accomplish this:

#  search /RegExp/ `files -o -f  -r -t TEXT DirectoryName`

#	Example:
	
		search /BitMapToRegion/ `files -o -f  -r -t TEXT "{mpw}"interfaces`
