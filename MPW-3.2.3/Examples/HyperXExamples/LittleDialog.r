#	HyperCard does not have a convention for resources belonging
#	to XCMDs or XFCNs. Currently using a resource mover to copy the
#	XCMD or XFCN to another stack can leave needed resources behind.
#	There are two things that can be done to help prevent such errors:
#
#	1. To indicate that a resource may belong to an XCMD, this example
#	uses resources having the same id number as the XCMD itself. This
#	is not a complete solution since it will not work for an XCMD
#	which has more than one resource of a given type. This is therefor
#	only a suggestion until a better means of bundling XCMDs with other
#	resources is developed.
#
#	2. Within the code of the XCMD, always check for the availability of
#	of the resource before it is to be used. Then report an error that
#	indicates what resource is missing.
