#	Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to
#	initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate 
#	successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories, 
#	and create, grow, and zoom windows.
#
#	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques 
#	you need for a large application. In particular, Sample 
#	does not cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, 
#	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of 
#	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.
#
#	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh 
#	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be 
#	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, 
#	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may 
#	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not 
#	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.
#
#	We recommend that you review this program or TESample before 
#	beginning a new application.

PROGRAM Sample;


{Segmentation strategy:

 This program consists of three segments. Main contains most of the code,
 including the MPW libraries, and the main program. Initialize contains
 code that is only used once, during startup, and can be unloaded after the
 program starts. %A5Init is automatically created by the Linker to initialize
 globals for the MPW libraries and is unloaded right away.}


{SetPort strategy:

 Toolbox routines do not change the current port. In spite of this, in this
 program we use a strategy of calling SetPort whenever we want to draw or
 make calls which depend on the current port. This makes us less vulnerable
 to bugs in other software which might alter the current port (such as the
 bug (feature?) in many desk accessories which change the port on OpenDeskAcc).
 Hopefully, this also makes the routines from this program more self-contained,
 since they don't depend on the current port setting.}

 the user quits an application, but then cancels a save of a document

PROCEDURE Initialize;

{Set up the whole world, including global variables, Toolbox managers,

 Since window storage is non-relocateable, how and when to allocate space
 for windows is very important so that heap fragmentation does not occur.
 Because Sample has only one window and it is only disposed when the application
 quits, we will allocate its space here, before anything that might be a locked
 relocatable object gets into the heap. This way, we can force its storage to be
 in the lowest memory available in the heap. Window storage can differ widely
 amongst applications depending on how many windows are created and disposed.
 If a failure occurs here, we will consider that the application is in such
 bad shape that we should just exit. Your error handling may differ, but
 the checks should still be made.}
 
{1.01 - The code that used to be part of ForceEnvirons has been moved into
 this module. If an error is detected, instead of merely doing an ExitToShell,
 which leaves the user without much to go on, we call AlertUser, which puts
 up a simple alert that just says an error occurred and then calls ExitToShell.
 In the interests of keeping things simple, the alert does not state the specific
 cause of the error, but a more informative alert would be appropriate for more
 sophisticated applications. Since there is no other cleanup needed at this point
 if an error is detected, this form of error- handling is acceptable. If more
 sophisticated error recovery is needed, a signal mechanism, such as is provided
 by Signals, can be used.}

	 that you have determined is the smallest heap the application can reasonably
	 work in. This number should be derived by examining the size of the heap that
	 is actually provided by MultiFinder when the minimum size requested is used.
	 The derivation of the minimum size requested from MultiFinder is described
	 in Sample.h. The check should be made because the preferred size can end up
	 being set smaller than the minimum size by the user. This extra check acts to

	 size, but a large scrap was loaded which left too little memory. To check for
	 this, call PurgeSpace and compare the result with a value that you have determined
	 is the minimum amount of free memory your application needs at initialization.
	 This number can be derived several different ways. One way that is fairly
	 straightforward is to run the application in the minimum size configuration
	 as described previously. Call PurgeSpace at initialization and examine the value
	 returned. However, you should make sure that this result is not being modified
	 by the scrap's presence. You can do that by calling ZeroScrap before calling
	 PurgeSpace. Make sure to remove that call before shipping, though.}

	{The extra benefit to waitng until after the Toolbox Managers have been initialized

	 an informative alert if memory became critical. Here we are acting more
	 in a preventative manner to avoid future disaster from low-memory problems.}
	 
	{We will allocate our own window storage instead of letting the Window
	 Manager for two reasons. One, GetNewWindow locks the 'WIND' resource
	 handle before calling NewWindow and this can lead to heap fragmentation.

1.01 - PROCEDURE DoCloseBehind(window: WindowPtr); was removed.

{1.01 - DoCloseBehind was a good idea for closing windows when quitting
 and not having to worry about updating the windows, but it suffered
 from a fatal flaw. If a desk accessory owned two windows, it would
 close both those windows when CloseDeskAcc was called. When DoCloseBehind
 got around to calling DoCloseWindow for that other window that was already
 closed, things would go very poorly. Another option would be to have a
 procedure, GetRearWindow, that would go through the window list and return
 the last window. Instead, we decided to present the standard approach
 of getting and closing FrontWindow until FrontWindow returns NIL. This
 has a potential benefit in that the window whose document needs to be saved
 may be visible since it is the front window, therefore decreasing the
 chance of user confusion. For aesthetic reasons, the windows in the
 application should be checked for updates periodically and have the
 updates serviced.}
