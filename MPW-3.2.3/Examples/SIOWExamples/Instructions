About the Example

	SIOW (Simple Input/Output Window) is a package that enables a program
	(C or Pascal), which does I/O in "glass teletype" fashion, to became a 
	stand-alone application running in its own window.  The various MPW 3.2
	Release Notes describe the behavior of such applications in detail.  In 
	brief, an input operation following a prompt will read only the characters
	that were actually typed or seleted.  That is, the prompt is not read unless
	it is explicitly selected.  Most of the items in the File, Edit, Font, and
	Size menus are available (not dimmed), and operate as one would expect.
	
	The only example provided presently is a version of Count, derived from the
	version to be found in CExamples.  The essential change is that the parameters:
	whether a count of lines, characters, or both is desired, and the list of
	files to be examined, are provided interactively at execution time.  In the
	version in CExamples, this information is taken from the command line.
	
Building the Example

	Set the default directory to "SIOWExamples:"
		
		This can be done either by the command 
		
			Directory "{MPW}"Examples:SIOWExamples:
			
		or by
		
			SetDirectory "{MPW}"Examples:SIOWExamples:
			
	Building the program
	
		You can create a makefile (overriding the one already supplied)
		by using the "Create Build Commands" item in the Build menu.
		When doing this, select the radio button entitled "SIOW App.".
		The application can then be built using any of the remaining 
		items: Build, Full Build, Show Build Commands, Show Full Build
		Commands.  The behavior of each of these is:
		
			Build…  -  The program is automatically built.  The commands
			used, and any error messages, are displayed in the Worksheet.
			Only files that have been changed since you last built the
			program are compiled, saving considerable time.
	
			Full Build…  -  The program is completely rebuilt, ignoring
			any object files or intermediate files that may already exist
			from a previous build.  The commands used, and any errors, are
			displayed in the Worksheet.
			
			Show Build Commands…  -  The commands needed to build the program
			are written to the Worksheet, but not executed.  You can then
			select any or all of the commands and execute them yourself.
			(To execute the commands select them and press Enter.)
			
			Show Full Build Commands…  -  The commands needed to completely
			rebuild the program are written to the Worksheet.  This is a
			convenient way to see all of the commands used in building
			the program you have selected.
			
		Alternatively, you can build the application by executing the 
		following command (this utilizes the the supplied file Count.make):
		
			BuildProgram Count ∑∑ {worksheet}
			
	Launching the program
	
		Count can be launched from MPW as if it were a tool, or, alternatively,
		it can be launched from the Finder in the same way as any other
		application.
