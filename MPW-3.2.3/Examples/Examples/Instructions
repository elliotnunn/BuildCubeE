Worksheet

	File:			{MPW}Worksheet

	Contents:	Introduction to Help
					Graphical Interfaces - Commando
					Introduction to Examples
					Frequently Used Commands
					Searching


	The Worksheet supplied with MPW contains brief introductions to
	the examples and the help facility, and a list of frequently used
	commands.

	Note:	 The Worksheet is the first window to appear when you run the
	MPW Shell.  If the Worksheet is empty, quit from the Shell and use the
	Finder to place the Worksheet file from the release disks in the
	same folder as the MPW Shell.  The files Startup, UserStartup, Suspend,
	Resume, and Quit, as well as the folders on the release disks, should
	also be in this same folder.  When these installation steps are complete,
	run the MPW Shell again.

	Note:  The notation {MPW}, used in various file names, is a variable in
	the Shell's command language.  It indicates the directory containing the
	files and folders supplied with MPW.
