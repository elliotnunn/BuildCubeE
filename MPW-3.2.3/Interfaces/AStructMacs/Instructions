About the Example


	A simple Assembly language program using the Structured Macros
	is included with MPW, called Sample.
	
	The source files for this example is in the
	"Interfaces:AStructMacs:" folder.  In addition, a makefile
	that contains the commands needed to build the example is
	provided in the same folder.
	

Building the Example

	You can easily build each of the sample programs using the Directory
	and Build menus.  (See Chapter 2 of the MPW Reference.)
	
	Set the default directory to "AStructMacs:"

		The simplest way to do this is to select from the Directory menu
		the menu item that ends in "AStructMacs:".  You can also set the
		default directory by using the Directory and SetDirectory commands.
		

	Build the program
	
		You can use any of the four Build items at the bottom of the Build
		menu to build the program. Each of these menu items displays
		a dialog box that asks for the name of the program
		you want to build.  When this dialog box appears, type 
		the name of the application to be built (sample).
		
		Each of the Build menu items behaves slightly differently:
		
			Build…  -  The program is automatically built.  The commands
			used, and any error messages, are displayed in the Worksheet.
			Only files that have been changed since you last built the
			program are compiled, saving considerable time.
	
			Full Build…  -  The program is completely rebuilt, ignoring
			any object files or intermediate files that may already exist
			from a previous build.  The commands used, and any errors, are
			displayed in the Worksheet.
			
			Show Build Commands…  -  The commands needed to build the program
			are written to the Worksheet, but not executed.  You can then
			select any or all of the commands and execute them yourself.
			(To execute the commands select them and press Enter.)
			
			Show Full Build Commands…  -  The commands needed to completely
			rebuild the program are written to the Worksheet.  This is a
			convenient way to see all of the commands used in building
			the program you have selected.


   Note: For more information about building the sample programs, see
   Chapter 2 of the MPW Reference.



Sample - A Simple Application

	Sample is an example application that demonstrates how to 
	use the Structured Macros.  It also demonstrates how the 
	Assembler DUMP/LOAD facility can be used with Macros.
