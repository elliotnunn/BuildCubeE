	Disassembler is a Pascal routine to be called to disassemble a sequence of
	bytes.  All MC68xxx, MC68881, and MC68851 instructions are supported.  The
	sequence of bytes to be disassembled are pointed to by FirstByte.  BytesUsed
	bytes starting at FirstByte are consumed by the disassembly, and the Opcode,
	Operand, and Comment strings returned as NULL TERMINATED Pascal strings (for
	easier manipulation with C).  The caller is then free to format or use the
	output strings any way appropriate to the application.
 
	Depending on the opcode and effective address(s) (EA's) to be disassembled,
	the Opcode, Operand, and Comment strings contain the following information:
	
	Case                     Opcode    Operand    Comment
	=======================================================================
	Non PC-relative EA's     op.sz     EA's				; 'c…' (for immediates)
	PC-relative EA's         op.sz     EA's       ; address
	Toolbox traps            DC.W      $AXXX      ; TB XXXX
	OS traps                 DC.W      $AXXX      ; OS XXXX
	Invalid bytes            DC.W      $XXXX      ; ????
	=======================================================================
	
	For valid disassembly of processor instructions the appropriate MC68XXX
	opcode mnemonic is generated for the Opcode string along with a size
	attribute when required. The source and destination EA's are generated as the
	Operand along with a possible comment.  Comments start with a ';'.  Traps use
	a DC.W assembler directive as the Opcode with the trap word as the Operand
	and a comment indicating whether the trap is a toolbox or OS trap and what
	the trap number is.  As described later the caller can generate symbolic
	substitutions into EA's and provide names for traps.
 
	Invalid instructions cause the string 'DC.W' to be returned in the Opcode
	string. Operand is '$XXXX' (the invalid word) with a comment of '; ????'.
  BytesUsed is 2. This is similar to the trap call case except for the comment.
 
	Note, the Operand EA's is syntatically similar to but NOT COMPATIBLE with the
	MPW assembler!	This is because the Disassembler generates byte hex constants
	as "$XX" and word hex constants as "$XXXX".  Negative values (e.g., $FF or
	$FFFF) produced by the Disassembler are treated as long word values by the MPW
	assembler.  Thus it is assumed that Disassembler output will NOT be used as
	MPW assembler input. If that is the goal, then the caller must convert strings
	of the form $XX or $XXXX in the Operand string to their decimal equivalent.
	The routine ModifyOperand is provided in this unit to aid with the conversion
	process.
 
	Since a PC-relative comment is an address, the only address that the
	Disassembler knows about is the address of the code pointed to by FirstByte.
  Generally, that may be a buffer that has no relation to "reality", i.e., the
	actual code loaded into the buffer.  Therefore, to allow the address comment
	to be mapped back to some actual address the caller may specify an adjustment
	factor, specified by DstAdjust that is ADDED to the value that normally would
	be placed in the comment.
 
	Operand effective address strings are generated as a function of the 
	effective address mode and a special case is made for A-trap opcode strings.
	In places where a possible symbolic reference could be substituted for an
	address (or a portion of an address), the Disassembler can call a user
	specified routine to do the substitution (using th LookupProc parameter
	described later).  The following table summarizes the generated effective
	addresses and where symbolic substitutions (S) can be made:

  ========================================================================

  For A-traps, the substitution can be performed to substitute for the DC.W
	opcode string.  If the substitution is made then the Disassembler will
	generate ,Sys and/or ,Immed flags as operands for Toolbox traps and
	,AutoPop for OS traps when the bits in the trap word indicates these
	settings.
	
					|         Generated          |            Substituted

	OS      | DC.W    $AXXX    ; OS XXXX | S       [,AutoPop]     ; AXXX
  ========================================================================

	All displacements (∂, BD, OD) are hexadecimal values shown as a byte ($XX),
	word ($XXXX), or long ($XXXXXXXX) as appropriate. The *Scale is suppressed if
	1. The Size is W or L.  Note that effective address substitutions can only be
	made for "∂(An)", "BD,An", and "*±∂" cases.
			
	For all the effective address modes 5, 6n, 7n, and for A-traps, a coroutine (a
	procedure) whose address is specified by the LookupProc parameter is called by
	the Disassembler (if LookupProc is not NIL) to do the substitution (or A-trap
	comment) with a string returned by the proc.  It is assumed that the proc
	pointed to by LookupProc is a level 1 Pascal proc declared as follows:
 
	PROCEDURE Lookup(		 PC:      UNIV Ptr;     {Addr of extension/trap word}
											 BaseReg: LookupRegs;   {Base register/lookup mode  }
											 Opnd:    UNIV LongInt; {Trap word, PC addr, disp.  }
									 VAR S:       Str255); 			{Returned substitution      }
		
	or in C,
	
	pascal void LookUp(Ptr         PC, 
	                   LookupRegs  BaseReg, 
										 long        Opnd, 
										 char        *S); 
 
	PC      = Pointer to instruction extension word or A-trap word in the
						buffer pointed to by the Disassembler's FirstByte parameter.
						
	BaseReg = This determines the meaning of the Opnd value and supplies
						the base register for the "∂(An)", "BD,An", and "*±∂" cases.
						BaseReg may contain any one of the following values:
					 
						_A0_    =  0 ==> A0
						_A1_    =  1 ==> A1
						_A2_    =  2 ==> A2
						_A3_    =  3 ==> A3
						_A4_    =  4 ==> A4
						_A5_    =  5 ==> A5
						_A6_    =  6 ==> A6
						_A7_    =  7 ==> A7
						_PC_    =  8 ==> PC-relative (special case)
						_ABS_   =  9 ==> Abs addr    (special case)
						_TRAP_  = 10 ==> Trap word   (special case)
	    		  _IMM_		= 11 ==> Immediate   (special case)
						
						For absolute addressing (modes 70 and 71), BaseReg contains _ABS_.
						For A-traps, BaseReg would contain _TRAP_.  For immediate data (mode
						74), BaseReg would contain _IMM_.
 
	Opnd    = The contents of this LongInt is determined by the BaseReg parameter
						just described.
				 
						For BaseReg = _IMM_ (immediate data):
							  Opnd contains the (extended) 32-bit immediate data specified by
								the instruction.

						For BaseReg = _TRAP_ (A-traps):
								Opnd is the entire trap word. The high order 16 bits of Opnd are
								zero.
 
						For BaseReg = _ABS_  (absolute effective address):
								Opnd contains the (extended) 32-bit address specifed by the
								instruction's effective address.  Such addresses would generally
								be used to reference low memory globals on a Macintosh.
 
						For BaseReg = _PC_  (PC-relative effective address):
								Opnd contains the 32-bit address represented by "*±∂" adjusted
								by the Disassembler's DstAdjust parameter.
								
						For BaseReg = _An_  (effective address with a base register):
								Opnd contains the (sign-extended) 32-bit (base) displacement
								from the instruction's effective address.
								
								In the Macintosh environment, a BaseReg specifying A5 implies
								either global data references or Jump Table references. Positive
								Opnd values with an A5 BaseReg thus mean Jump Table references,
								while a negative offset would mean a global data reference.
								Base registers of A6 or A7 would usually mean local data.
 
	S       = Pascal string returned from Lookup containing the effective address
						substitution string or a trap name for A-traps.  S is set to null
						PRIOR to calling Lookup.  If it is still null on return, the string
						is not used.  If not null, then for A-traps, the returned string is
						used as a opcode string. In all other cases the string is
						substituted as shown in the above table.
						 
	Depending on the application, the caller has three choices on how to use the
	Disassembler and an associated Lookup proc:
 
	(1). The caller can call just the Disassembler and provide his own Lookup
			 proc. In that case the calling conventions discussed above must be
			 followed.
 
	(2). The caller can provide NIL for the LookupProc parameter, in which case,
			 NO Lookup proc will be called.
			 
	(3). The caller can call first InitLookup (described below, a proc provided
			 with this unit) and pass the address of this unit's standard Lookup proc
			 when Disassembler is called.	In this case all the control logic to
			 determine the kind of substitution to be done is provided for the caller
			 and all that need to be provided by the user are routines to look up any
			 or all of the following:
			 
			 • PC-relative references
			 • Jump Table references
			 • Absolute address references
			 • Trap names
			 • Immediate data names
			 • References with offsets from base registers													*/

	offsets from a base register, the associated level 1 Pascal proc specified

  The operand to be processed is	passed as the function's parameter which is
	edited "in place" and returned to the caller.

	This routine is essentially a pattern matcher and attempts to only modify 2, 4,

	are output (because that indicates a value's size -- byte, word, or long).

	For a hex string to be modified, the following tests must be passed:

	• There must have been exactly 2, 4, or 8 digits.

		Only hex strings $XX, $XXXX, and $XXXXXXXX are possible candidates because
		that is the only way the Disassembler generates offsets.

	• Hex string must be delimited by a "(" or a ",".

		The "(" allows offsets for $XXXX(An,...) and $XX(An,Xn) addressing modes.
		The comma allows for the MC68020 addressing forms.

	• The "$X..." must NOT be preceded by a "±".

		This eliminates the possibility of modifying the offset of a PC-relative
		addressing mode always generated in the form "*±$XXXX".
	
	• The "$X..." must NOT be preceded by a "#".
	
		This eliminates modifying immediate data.

	• Value must be negative.

		Negative values are the only values we modify.  A value $FFFF is modified to
		-$0001.

extern char *validMacsBugSymbol(char *symStart, void *limit,
																char *symbol);
	/*
	Check that the bytes pointed to by symStart represents a valid MacsBug symbol.
	The symbol must be fully contained in the bytes starting at symStart, up to,
	but not including, the byte pointed to by the limit parameter.
	
	If a valid symbol is NOT found, then NULL is returned as the function's result.
	However, if a valid symbol is found, it is copied to symbol (if it is not NULL)
	as a null terminated Pascal string, and return a pointer to where we think the
	FOLLOWING module begins. In the "old style" cases (see below) this will always
	be 8 or 16 bytes after the input symStart.  For new style Apple Pascal and C
	cases this will depend on the symbol length, existence of a pad byte, and size
	of the constant (literal) area.  In all cases, trailing blanks are removed from
	the symbol.
	
	A valid MacsBug symbol consists of the characters '_', '%', spaces, digits, and
	upper/lower case letters in a format determined by the first two bytes of the
	symbol as follows:
	
	 1st byte  | 2nd byte  |  Byte  |
		 Range   |  Range    | Length | Comments
	==============================================================================
	 $20 - $7F | $20 - $7F |    8   | "Old style" MacsBug symbol format
	 $A0 - $7F | $20 - $7F |    8   | "Old style" MacsBug symbol format
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 $20 - $7F | $80 - $FF |   16   | "Old style" MacApp symbol ab==>b.a
	 $A0 - $7F | $80 - $FF |   16   | "Old style" MacApp symbol ab==>b.a
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 $80       | $01 - $FF |    n   | n = 2nd byte       (Apple Compiler symbol)
	 $81 - $9F | $00 - $FF |    m   | m = 1st byte & $7F (Apple Compiler symbol)
	==============================================================================
	
	The formats are determined by whether bit 7 is set in the first and second
	bytes.  This bit will removed when we find it or'ed into the first and/or
	second valid symbol characters.
	
	The first two formats in the above table are the basic "old style" (pre-
	existing) MacsBug formats. The first byte may or may not have bit 7 set the
	second byte is a valid symbol character.  The first byte (with bit 7 removed)
	and the next 7 bytes are assumed to comprise the symbol.
	
	The second pair of formats are also "old style" formats, but used for MacApp
	symbols.  Bit 7 set in the second character indicates these formats. The symbol
	is assumed to be 16 bytes with the second 8 bytes preceding the first 8 bytes
	in the generated symbol.  For example, 12345678abcdefgh represents the symbol
	abcdefgh.12345678.
	
	The last pair of formats are reserved by Apple and generated by the MPW Pascal
	and C compilers.  In these cases the value of the first byte is always between
	$80 and $9F, or with bit 7 removed, between $00 and $1F.  For $00, the second
	byte is the length of the symbol with that many bytes following the second
	byte (thus a max length of 255). Values $01 to $1F represent the length itself.
	A pad byte may follow these variable length cases if the symbol does not end
	on a word boundary.  Following the symbol and the possible pad byte is a word
	containing the size of the constants (literals) generated by the compiler.
	
	Note that if symStart actually does point to a valid MacsBug symbol, then you
	may use showMacsBugSymbol to convert the MacsBug symbol bytes to a string that
	could be used as a DC.B operand for disassembly purposes.  This string
	explicitly shows the MacsBug symbol encodings.
