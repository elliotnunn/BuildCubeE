	As of MPW 3.0, interface files were reorganized to more closely
	match "Inside Macintosh" reference books and be more consistant
	from language to language.
	
	Interfaces for the Palette Manager are now found in Palettes.h.
	This file, which includes Palettes.h, is provided for compatibility
	with old sources.
