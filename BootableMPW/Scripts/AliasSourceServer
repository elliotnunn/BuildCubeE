#		Scripts that have Projector commands within them can normally not be 
#	executed by ToolServer. Using SourceServer, the RProj tool, and three support
#	scripts (AliasSourceServer, UnaliasSourceServer, and Directory2), ToolServer
#	can perform Projector functions. SourceServer must be running on the same
#	computer as ToolServer before the Projector scripts can be executed.
#	Individual Projector command lines are sent from ToolServer to SourceServer
#	via AppleEvents by the RProj tool. To allow RProj to automatically be invoked
#	any time a Projector command is encountered, we use the AliasSourceServer
#	script to alias each ProjectorCommand to "RProj ProjectorCommand". To make
#	sure that the aliases remain in effect even after the AliasSourceServer script
#	has finished running, we must use the command line, "Execute AliasSourceServer".
#	Directory commands also need to be aliased to Directory2, which will keep the
#	current directory of both ToolServer and SourceServer set to the same location
#	so both Projector and non-Projector commands operate on the same set of files.
#	This alias is also established by the AliasSourceServer script. Finally, after
#	completion of the Projector commands, "Execute UnaliasSourceServer" restores
#	ToolServer to it's normal operation.
#
#		This file, AliasSourceServer, sets up aliases for ToolServer to reroute
#	Projector commands, via the RProj tool, to SourceServer.

#		Finally, we synchronize the current directory settings between both ToolServer
#	and SourceServer by calling our newly aliased Directory command.
