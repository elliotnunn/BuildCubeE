#	The file UserStartup can be used to override definitions made in Startup,
#	or to define additional variables, exports, and aliases.  UserStartup may
#	also be used to define menu items, open windows, etc.  The file should be
#	located in the directory containing the MPW Shell, or in your preferences 
# 	folder.

			If "{PrefsFolder}" && "`Exists "{PrefsFolder}UserStartup"`"
				Execute "{PrefsFolder}UserStartup"
			Else
				Execute "{ShellDirectory}UserStartup"
			End
			
#	Since UserStartup is distributed with MPW, you may want to have other
#	startup files that will not be overwritten with a new release.
#	Other personalized startup files may be named UserStartup•≈ - such as 
#	"UserStartup•John" or "UserStartup•Tom"  (• is option-8).
#	These files should be located in the directory containing the MPW Shell,
#	or in the {PrefFolder}.  The following executes such files found in either 
#   place.

			If "{PrefsFolder}"
				For __Startup__i in `(Files "{PrefsFolder}"UserStartup•≈ || Set Status 0) ≥ dev:null`
